# ClasyficationModelBasedOnMushroomData

This example demonstrates the process of exploratory data analysis, model construction, and evaluation for a classification problem. The analysis was carried out using Apache Spark.

**Key Components:**

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** 
   - The data was first examined to understand its structure and characteristics. This involved checking the distribution of features, handling missing values, and identifying anomalies.
   - Key insights were drawn from the data, such as the distribution of the target variable and the relationships between different features.

2. **Model Construction:**
   - Several classification models were built to predict whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous. The models included:
     - **Logistic Regression:** A simple linear model used as a baseline.
     - **Decision Tree:** A model that splits the data into regions based on feature values.
     - **Random Forest:** An ensemble of decision trees to improve accuracy and robustness.
     - **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** A model that finds the optimal hyperplane to separate classes.
     - **Gradient Boosting:** An ensemble model that builds decision trees sequentially to correct errors.

3. **Model Evaluation:**
   - The models were evaluated based on accuracy, F1-score, and their performance on different classes.
   - Metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score were used to assess the balance between correctly identifying edible and poisonous mushrooms.
   - Potential issues like overfitting were addressed, and hyperparameter tuning was performed to improve model performance.

**Tool Used:**
- **Apache Spark:** Employed for its ability to handle and process large datasets efficiently.
- **Google Colaboratory:** The analysis was conducted in Google Colaboratory, providing an interactive environment for developing and running the code. Additional descriptions, comments, and detailed explanations are available directly in the provided Colab notebook.

This comprehensive approach ensures that the classification models are well-tuned and perform effectively on the mushroom dataset.
Notebook was created with Google Colab and is designed to run in it. If you want to run Notepad locally, **you need to make sure that the appropriate libraries are available in your virtual environment**.
